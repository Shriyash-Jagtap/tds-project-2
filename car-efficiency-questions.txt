Analyze `sample-car-efficiency.csv`.

Return a JSON object with keys:
- `average_combined_mpg`: number
- `most_efficient_car`: string
- `fuel_type_efficiency`: object with fuel types as keys and average combined MPG as values
- `price_efficiency_correlation`: number
- `engine_size_mpg_correlation`: number
- `efficiency_by_fuel_chart`: base64 PNG string under 100kB
- `mpg_vs_price_scatter`: base64 PNG string under 100kB

Answer:
1. What is the average combined MPG across all cars?
2. Which car model has the highest combined MPG?
3. What is the average combined MPG for each fuel type (Gasoline, Hybrid, Electric)?
4. What is the correlation between price and combined MPG?
5. What is the correlation between engine size and combined MPG? (Exclude electric cars with 0.0L engines)
6. Create a bar chart showing average combined MPG by fuel type with green bars. Encode as base64 PNG.
7. Create a scatter plot of combined MPG vs price with blue dots. Encode as base64 PNG.
