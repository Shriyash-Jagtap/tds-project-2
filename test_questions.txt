Return a JSON object with keys:
- edge_count: number
- highest_degree_node: string  
- average_degree: number
- density: number
- shortest_path_alice_eve: number
- network_graph: base64 PNG string under 100kB
- degree_histogram: base64 PNG string under 100kB

How many edges are in the network?
Which node has the highest degree?
What is the average degree of the network?
What is the network density?
What is the length of the shortest path between Alice and Eve?
Draw the network with nodes labelled and edges shown.
Plot the degree distribution as a bar chart with green bars.
